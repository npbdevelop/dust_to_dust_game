# dust_to_dust_game

# My first game, developed in C++ over SFML and OpenGL. Most of my experience is in scientific programming and this is my first major passion project so if you're reading this
# and have feedback, don't hesitate to check out my profile and reach out. I'm nice :)

# Current stage of development is refining the collision system and implementing different scene functionality, as well as getting gravity mechanics working.

# The general end goal is to have a final fantasy / mother 3 style game that uses 8-bit-esque graphics and has a sudo-turn-based battle system.

# The rough plot is as follows:

# You wake up in the underworld as just a skull, with no memory of who you are, where you came from, or how you got here. As you get accustomed to your new surroundings and the
# difficulties of living and moving as just a skull, you discover a community of... people? who are living a party lifestyle that obviously clashes with the world you find yourselves
# in. However, the warm welcome in such a dangerous place eases your anxiety and you begin life in the most laid back fire-and-brimstone hellscape imaginable. It's dangerous here,
# pain and suffering are the norm, but nobody seems to mind since it's all in exchange for absolute freedom and unlimited personal expression.

# However, though those around you share in your amnesia, through your journey to build a decent life down here, you unexpectedly begin to gain memories of a previous life. You have
# no way of knowing if these memories are of your previous life, or if you are peering into a life that never belonged to you. Because the beings around you all share the dismay
# of totally losing their identity, you decide to keep these memories to yourself... for as long as you can bear. But the pain of loss overwhelms you; a loss that, in lieu of your
# memories, you would not know. You are conflicted between seeking out more about yourself and why this is happening to you, or just trying to forget it all and embrace your new
# existence.

# The world you find yourself in is perilous and excrutiatingly painful, but the consequences of death and destruction are minimal, as they are the norm. You experince death as a 
# person up above would experience their drive to work, and quickly become desensitized to the torture that is routine life. But as you build an identity within yourself, you wonder
# if there isn't an alternative to this dismal existence. And if there is one, who's to say it's any better?
